Hello visitors.  

This is my first blog, I use **markdown** syntax to write this post.  
I heard the markdown a few years ago, but never write it before, the blog and
something about this are totally a new thing for me, I think this will get more
and more interesting.

This blog is deploy by **Octopress**, and host on the **github**.
These stuff are very excellent and remarkable, but these are totally free and
open, I just want thank these guys who work on that, and wish someday I will
be the one of these people.
